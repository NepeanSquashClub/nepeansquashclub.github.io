                    <h1>House league and rules</h1>
                    <p>
                        We have more than 50 House league <strong>players</strong>, from <strong>beginner</strong> all
                        the way up to <strong>advanced</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Scheduling process</h2>
                    <p><ul>
                        <li>
                            At the beginning of each month, Lillian emails the house ladder rankings based on the
                            previous month's matches, as well as the updated membership list.  You are in a "house" with
                            either 4 or 5 other players. For your house league matches, you contact only the people
                            within your house and enter scores based on the results. For example, someone in House B
                            will play their matches with others in House B.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You then look up a player's email to set up a match with each player in your house before
                            the month is over, and record your scores on the Club's notice board next to the Athletics
                            Desk.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you win all your matches, you move up the ladder, if you lose all of them, you move down.
                            Each game is to 11 points, and you must win by 2 points (if tied). The first player to win 3
                            games is the match winner. You can also arrange friendly games throughout the month with
                            other club players.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Most players choose to use a double yellow dot ball for house league matches.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            4 courts are available with a viewing gallery upstairs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Think safety: Nepean Squash Club strongly recommends using eye protection!

                    <h2>Expectations from the House League Coordinator</h2>
                    <p>
                        You need only play at least two matches per month to remain in the house league. Because
                        it is unfair to other players in that box, please honour the commitment as much as
                        possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're unable to play even once, but want to remain in the house league, please
                        contact the house league coordinator who will try to accommodate you. However, if it
                        becomes a "habit", you could be asked you to drop out until you're able to play on a
                        regular basis as it's unfair to your house mates.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Opponents cancelling or not showing up</h2>
                    <p>
                        It occasionally happens I will penalize someone not knowing that that person has tried, but
                        failed, to play one or more of his/her opponents. His/her opponent(s) either cancelled at the
                        last minute, or didn't show up for a match at all, and the score sheet doesn't reflect this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would appreciate knowing when this occurs. If you're stood up at the Sportsplex by your
                        opponent not showing up, please mark 3-0 in the score sheet. You can add a comment, if you wish,
                        that your opponent defaulted by not showing up. If, however, you're able to complete that match
                        later that month, please do so. <strong>Unilaterally entering scores in the score sheet is not
                        allowed</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you feel you've made a good faith effort throughout the month to contact your opponent and
                        your opponent hasn't replied, or has cancelled a scheduled match, please email me
                        (<a href="mailto:lkitcher@gmail.com" target="_blank">lkitcher@gmail.com</a>) to let me know.
                        I'll try to take this into account at the end of the month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have to assume everyone will be honest here. Remember that the primary reason for the house
                        league is to play others of similar skill, and for everyone to enjoy themselves.
                    </p>
