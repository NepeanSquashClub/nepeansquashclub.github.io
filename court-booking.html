                        You can still book by phone <a href="tel:6135802828" class="no-underline">
                        <span class="icon solid fa-phone-alt"></span>&nbsp;</a>
                        <a href="tel:6135802828">613-580-2828</a>, but online booking is much easier and faster. You
                        can clearly see what courts #1,2,3,4 are available for each time slot both for "today" and the
                        "next" day, and after 6 pm, even the "following" day. You also get a confirmation email
                        immediately, as well as giving you the option to cancel later if required.

                        <li>You are willing to play against an opponent who will probably not be wearing a mask.</li>
                        <li>
                            You are agreeable to playing a house league opponent who might not be at the same level
                            until a few months of play sorts it out.

                            The Nepean Squash Club does not assume responsibility for any risk you assume while
                            participating in club activities, nor when using any of the Nepean Sportsplex facilities.
                            The City of Ottawa is solely responsible for the booking, operations and cleaning of the
                            Nepean Sportsplex facility, change rooms and squash courts, as well as the screening of
                            players who enter the facility. That being said, the club, as in the past, will be
                            attentive to any concerns raised by club members and endeavour to bring about positive
                            change. The purpose of the club is to facilitate the arranging of matches between players
                            through the house league ladder list distributed by email each month to members, and as
                            conditions allow, in periodic club social nights, drop-ins, tournaments and city league
                            play.
